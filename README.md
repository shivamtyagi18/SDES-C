# SDES-C
SDES using C 

In my final year in B.Tech I got interested in Cryptography and thus took it as my final year elective as well as the major project. I worked on SDES cryptography algorithm and developed an SDES encryptor-decryptor using C. The project accredited me with experience of development of software using an established algorithm. In this project I designed a code that accepted user input and performed encryption or decryption as per the user requirement.
